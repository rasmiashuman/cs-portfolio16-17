<h1> How to create a Calculator</h1>

<p> There are many steps to create a calculator, creating a calculator has many
different aspects. One of them being different languages. The first aspect/ languages
used to create my calculator is HTML. HTML stands for Hyper Text Mark up Language.
HTML could be looked at as the "bulding blocks" of the code. So to walk you
through how I created my code I have to explain the most common used elements
of HTML that I used. The first would be, 
- Brackets so for all HTML we use lots of angle brackets. Angle Brackets 
make up a tag. So to form any type of text or body, you open and close a tag
like shown below. 
- Inside the brackets, determine how big the text is, and what it looks like
- It could be inserted as a a paragrah tag that would look like (p) 
and it could be inserted as a header that would look like this (h1) or even more. 
So to get how I created the calculator it starts to get more complicated, 
I needed to insert a button and options and a navbar. So shown below we use tags 
to determine the exterior with HTML. 
Next is JavaScript, Javascript is a little more complicated, 
JavaScript I would say decided how everyhting works. 
Java script is the interior of the code. 
Some elements used in javascript would be the variables, 
like shown below var is the begining of a variable, and it starts to control
what the HTML is doing and what it looks like. 
Other common Javascript tags are, 
-Function 
- else if
- document.getElementByID, and more.
