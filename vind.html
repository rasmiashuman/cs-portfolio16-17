<h1>How I Created my Bot</h1>

<div  class = "box">
    
    <h2> What is Vindinium?</h2>
    <p> Vindinium is a game where you program robots using artificial intellegence 
to do things that you want them to; such as attack enemy mines and go to the taverns.
Both of these things gain points and life for each robot and the robot with the most
points after the time is up wins. I personally have created a bot for Vindinium and it is called MiaBot. 
She has won multiple games and is very successful, especially against Xenold and RichieBot.

</p>
<h2>Setting up Vindinuim </h2>

<p> Setting up the vindinuim is the base of the whole bot. So it is very important that you get it right.
The first couple of steps on creating the vindinuim is setting uo your workspace. While creating your workspace.
make sure the workspace is set up in node. If it was not your bot would not function. When you have finsished
setting up your vindinuim, you have to start programming it to make your bot function the way you would like. 
The reason you have to start programming it the way you like is because, the bot is already programmed to be 
random. After it is in random it just goes and does what it wants randomly, and there would be a less chance of winning.
The code for creating your empty bot is:
<code class = "code">
    </div>
    </center>
    <pre>
        
        //the var tags name variables so that you can use them later on in the code
var Bot = require('bot');
var PF = require('pathfinding');
var bot = new Bot('YOUR_KEY_HERE', 'training', 'http://vindinium.org'); //Put your bot's code here and change training to Arena when you want to fight others.
var bot = new Bot('e2g37nk9', 'training', 'http://v.summitdevclub.com:9000'); //Put your bot's code here and change training to Arena when you want to fight others.
var goDir;
var Promise = require('bluebird');
Bot.prototype.botBrain = function() {
    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
        _this = bot;
        //////* Write your bot below Here *//////
        //////* Set `myDir` in the direction you want to go and then bot.goDir is set to myDir at the bottom *////////

        /*                                      *
         * This Code is global data!            *
         *  bot.bot#.mineCount                                    */
          // Set myDir to what you want and it will set bot.goDir to that direction at the end.  Unless it is "none"
        var myDir;
        //This has the x and y variables whih shows my posititionh
        var myPos = [bot.yourBot.pos.x, bot.yourBot.pos.y];

        //
        var enemyBots = [];
        if (bot.yourBot.id != 1) enemyBots.push(bot.bot1);
        if (bot.yourBot.id != 2) enemyBots.push(bot.bot2);
        if (bot.yourBot.id != 3) enemyBots.push(bot.bot3);
        if (bot.yourBot.id != 4) enemyBots.push(bot.bot4);

<h2>Mines/Taverns/Attacking</h2>

<p> Creating the mines is a lot harder than setting up the vindinuim, this is like addind something to an empty box. 
The Vindinuim is the empty and ready to be programmed.To find the mines you create statements that allow the bot to go 
do what you allow them to do, inside a statement. For example, I want my bot to go get the mines that are open, and have not been
taken from anyone else. So like in the code below I would use the code bot.freemines in order to get those mines and plug them into
an if else statement along with the other statements like the taverns, and the attacking other mines. The code below will show how
I plugged in the statements for the free mines and more. 
 The code looks something like this:  
 </center> </div>
 <code class = "code">
 <pre>
              if (task === "NAME#");
              var X = bot.Y[0];
              for (i = 0; i < X.length; i++) {
               if (bot.findDistance(myPos, X) > bot.findDistance(myPos, bot.Y[i])) {
               openMines = bot.Y[i];
                 }
                 console.log("SAY SOMETHING GOOD");
                   myDir = bot.findPath(myPos, X);
                 }
                 
                 </pre>
                 </code>
                 
                 <center> <div class = "box">
It is asking what the if task is, after you put the name of the task under name, you plug in what x is used as a name, 
after the name is plugged into every x spot. You plug in the y variable, the y would be what the code is for the task. After everything, the 
code for everything ends up looking like this:

<code class = "code">

        var task = "collectMines";

// the if tasks are consistant of a couple of things, x and y. They will be filled in at certain places of the code, the x is basically a name the y variable the command

            for (i = 0; i < openMines.length; i++) {

<h1> Comments</h1>

<p1> So after creating your bot and making it the best bot of all. You have to add comments so your code is more 
readable. Some comments that were mentioned in my code, are

<h1> What I learned</h1>

<p1> Throughout this project I learned the most I have ever learned throughout my time in computer science.
I created a virtual robot and coded it to fight other virtual robots that my peers created, which caused me 
to learn a lot about programming some things that aren't websites, which a skill I could definelty use 
later on in life. This project inspires me to do more with computer science and explore all of the options, 
this class/subject offers me.</p1>
